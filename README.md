# Developing a Multilingual Dataset and Evaluation Metrics for Code-Switching: A Focus on Hong Kong's Polylingual Dynamics

we present the impressive results of **Whisper-MCE**, our fine-tuned Whisper, which was trained using our self-collected dataset, Mixed Cantonese and English **(MCE)** audio dataset, which is generated by our **Multi-Agent Data Generation Framework(MADGF)**. Whisper-MCE achieved an impressive Mix Error Rate (MER) of **14.28%**, which is **35.13%** lower than the original model. It also achieved **12.61%** Character Error Rate (CER) in Common voice zh-HK, positioning it as state-of-the-art. [[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17953)]

## üöÄ News
- [02/03/2025] We will release a more extensive code-switching dataset [SwitchiLingua](https://github.com/Shelton1013/SwitchLingua) with support for additional languages
- [21/12/2024] MCE is accepted by ICASSP 2025!
- [12/06/2024] The MCE Dataset is released! 
- [27/10/2023] The manuscript can be found on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17953).

  
## üìä MCE Dataset
You can download the [MCE Dataset from the Google cloud](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CFgHxTzYBKnIkRVBdCwlJXahZq3Zi87B/view?usp=sharing).

MCE Dataset folder has two folders:</br>
- Audio: mixed Cantonese and English audio files, 160 audio folders</br>
  - `1-160` is the original audio data</br>
  - `1_deal-160_deal` is the cleaned original audio data</br>
  - `1_MCE-160_MCE` is the training format audio data</br>
we provided the training format audio data </br>

- Text: mixed Cantonese and English text (Generated by MADGF) files, 160 CSV files</br>
format(topic, text content)</br>

The MCE Dataset is collected by students from HKUST, **each students have their own name rule and their audio files have different formats.**


## üèãÔ∏è Whisper-MCE

## Requirements
1. Clone this repository and navigate to MMed-RAG folder
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Shelton1013/Whisper_MCE.git
cd Whisper_MCE
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Our fine-tuned Model: [Whisper-MCE](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14_IFvi0z8zHNJGYetpW5GHxbS0z6p0dt/view?usp=sharing)</br>

Baseline: [Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper)

Use our fine-tuned Whisper-MCE for speech recognition
```bash
python Whisper_mce.py --model_path "your model path" --audio_path "your test audio path"
```

For model fine-tuning, we use single A100(80G) GPUs.


## üìÖ Schedule
We are currently working on a more extensive code-switching dataset [SwitchiLingua](https://github.com/Shelton1013/SwitchLingua) with support for additional languages, which will be released in the near future. We look forward to sharing it with the research community.
